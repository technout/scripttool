# scripttool
Small Python GUI tool to execute some bash commands
I started this project to learn to make a GUI application in Python.

The GUI is made with PAGE, a wysiwyg interface building tool to generate the code for the Python GUI.
Quote from the PAGE project: "PAGE is aimed at a user who wants to rapidly construct a GUI and is willing to compromise generality for ease and speed of construction. It is a helper tool. It does not build an entire application but rather is aimed at building a single GUI window. It is not a Python Interactive Design Environment (IDE). [..]"
